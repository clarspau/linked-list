# Arrays/Linked Lists

This exercise focuses on building and manipulating linked lists in Python. The main tasks include implementing methods for adding, removing, and manipulating nodes within the linked list. Additionally, there are further study opportunities for more advanced linked list operations.


## Methods to Implement

### Basic Methods

- push(val): Append a new node with the given value to the tail.
- unshift(val): Add a new node with the given value to the head.
- pop(): Remove and return the value of the tail node.
- shift(): Remove and return the value of the head node.
- getAt(idx): Retrieve the value at the specified index.
- setAt(idx, val): Set the value of the node at the specified index.
- insertAt(idx, val): Insert a new node at the specified index.
- removeAt(idx): Remove and return the value at the specified index.

### Average of List

- average(): Given a linked list containing numbers, return the average of those numbers.
